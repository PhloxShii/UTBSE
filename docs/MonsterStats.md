# UTBE Monster Stats Documentation

* I'ma js give a template and you should be able to easily figure out what to do if you KNOW how to code lol

* Template:
```haxe
        monster = new Monster(100, 100, "Template"); // X POS, Y POS, Monster name
		monster.data.health = 25; // How much health you want your monster to have at the start of the battle
		monster.data.maxHealth = 25; // Max ammount of health your monster can have
		monster.data.attack = 5; // How much damage your monster does to the player
		monster.data.defense = 1; // How much defense your monster has
		monster.data.xpReward = 10; // How much XP your monster gives
		monster.data.goldReward = 2; // How much Gold your monster gives
```
